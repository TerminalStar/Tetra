# Tetra
An interface for the mutation testing tool Mutiny.

Completed as part of a final year project at the University of York, for the degree of MEng in Computer Science.

## Usage
### OSX/Linux
Within the Tetra directory, run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`, then go to 127.0.0.1:8000/app/results.html.

### Windows
I used XAMPP but any simple server will do.
